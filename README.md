# BrowserReset

Browser Reset is a C# Console Application that will manually reset Firefox and Chrome Extensions and Preferences (such as homepage).

The program also has the capability to bring up the reset feature built in to Internet Explorer.

# Install

This program was made in Visual Studio and can be cloned directly back into Visual Studio using their built in git functionality. If cloning outside of Visual Studio the solution file included in the repository should work just fine.

I have also added the already built executable file under Releases
